Hello!

This is a summary of my coursework for CS 237 - Data Structures and Algorithms. The work is very "scattered" around, but I tried to organize it as best as I could. I didn't really create it with the intentions of sharing it, so it's a bit disorganized. Some of the projects are in Eclipse, and some are in Visual Studio. Regardless, they are mostly cross-platform/IDE, so they should work no matter where you try to use them. If you have any questions, please contact me. 

This work is written in C++ - as I mentioned earlier, some of the projects are Visual Studio (.sln) projects, and others are Eclipse projects - the raw .cpp and .h files will work in either environment.

Assignments: Two-week deadlines, more difficult and thorough version of Labs.
Labs: Due weekly, used to implement concepts learned in the classroom.
